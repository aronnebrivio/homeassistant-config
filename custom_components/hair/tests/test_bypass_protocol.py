"""The raw pin, end to end (Highlights, GH #78).

kno-te's Dreo Power code is a Symphony repeat-train: six or seven frames
with ~7 ms gaps, captured as one blob. HAIR decodes it, re-encodes one
clean frame, and the fan ignores it. The device-command toggle already
fixed that on a device; nothing else in the chain could say it.

What these tests protect is the CHAIN. The pin has to survive capture,
Test, assign, export, share, CLIP and adopt, and it dies silently at any
boundary that forgets to copy one field. Each hop below is a boundary
that was carrying ``send_count`` already and had to learn one more knob:

    sniffed / pasted signal
        -> Test           (signal_monitor.test_signal)
        -> assign         (_apply_signal_provenance)
        -> device command (device_manager gate)
        -> export         (wig_export -> bypass_protocol)
        -> wig file       (in the hash, only when true)
        -> adopt          (-> tx_force_raw again)
        -> CLIP           (three separate touch points)

A miss anywhere produces a wig that looks right, hashes right, fits
right, and transmits wrong.
