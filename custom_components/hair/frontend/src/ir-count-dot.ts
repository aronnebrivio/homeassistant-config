/**
 * Shared count-aware corner dot for action buttons.
 *
 * Renders nothing for count < 1 and a numbered 10px badge for count >= 1
 * (stretching to a pill for double digits). Every count shows its number,
 * including 1 -- a bare dot next to numbered siblings read as a different,
 * lesser indicator (owner ruling, v0.6.6 bench). Colour is the only
 * difference between the green Assign dot and the yellow Trigger dot.
 *
 * The calling button is responsible for positioning: it sets
 * ``position: relative`` and places the dot in its top-right corner via its
 * own CSS. Keeping the offset out of this component lets it ride on buttons
 * of any width.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   <ir-count-dot color="green" .count=${sig.assignment_count ?? 0}></ir-count-dot>
 *   <ir-count-dot color="yellow" .count=${triggerCount}></ir-count-dot>
 *   <ir-count-dot color="grey" .count=${sendCount}></ir-count-dot>
