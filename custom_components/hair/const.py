# an ID, only the display name) keeps resolving after any number of

# gets renamed constantly does not grow this list unbounded; 10 covers any

# Trigger dedup window (v0.5.7, resized v0.5.8). A single physical press
# captured by several receivers within this window counts as one press per
# (trigger, fingerprint): it increments a trigger's hit state once and fires
# each matching trigger at most once. Composes with min_hits (distinct
# presses still accumulate).
#
# Since v0.5.8 the window SLIDES (each suppressed capture refreshes it), so it
# must only cover the gap BETWEEN consecutive frames of one press, not the
# whole burst. It is sized against the widest inter-frame gap we know of:
# Sony SIRC repeats a full frame about every 45ms while a button is held.
# 100ms leaves real headroom for a jittery receiver without approaching a
# human double-press interval (150ms+ between distinct presses, since a
# release and re-press cannot happen faster).
MULTI_RECEIVER_DEDUP_WINDOW_S = 0.100

# The matrix listener's own window (owner ruling 2026-08-18, after the
# dress rehearsal): ONE PRESS IS ONE EVENT. An AC state frame is not a
# repeat frame the way Sony's is -- the code is two complete frames of
# one press, and the bench measured them arriving 103 to 148 ms apart
# through a real receiver, just outside the 100 ms above. Every press of
# a two-frame cell therefore fired hair_state_heard twice and saved the
# store twice. Nobody could see it before the receiver-tolerant tier,
# because these codes never matched at all over the air.
#
# 400 ms, RAISED FROM 300 (owner ruling 2026-08-18, second bench pass).
# Fifty presses through the ESPHome transmitter put 29 of 30 AC presses
# inside 300 ms and one at 330, which counted twice. A human cannot
# release and re-press an air conditioner's handset inside 400 ms, so
# the wider window costs nothing real and turns that split into the
# non-event it always was.
#
# Keyed on (remote, cell) rather than the remote alone, so a deliberate
# change of state inside the window -- cool 23 then off -- is still two
# events.
MATRIX_STATE_DEDUP_WINDOW_S = 0.400

# Trigger fire dedup (owner ruling 2026-08-18, after the regression bench).
# ONE TAP IS ONE FIRE, including on a handset that repeats the whole frame
# while the button is down.
#
# The bench measured a Samsung32 handset repeating its full frame every 102
# to 119 ms on an ordinary tap. That sits just outside the 100 ms
# MULTI_RECEIVER_DEDUP_WINDOW_S the trigger path used to borrow, so a single
# tap fired two to four times, and which it was came down to about ten
# milliseconds of jitter. Sony's 45 ms repeats were the only spacing that
# window was ever sized against; a full-frame repeater was not.
#
# ANCHORED, NOT SLIDING. The stamp is written only when a capture is allowed
# through, never when one is suppressed. That is the difference that makes a
# held button usable: with a sliding window a hold is one fire for as long as
# the frames keep coming, and the release is invisible; anchored, the window
# expires on schedule and the next repeat re-fires.
#
# 300 ms (owner ruling 2026-08-18, second pass and CONFIRMED on a third:
# 300 stands. A later bench tap whose frames spanned 318 ms fired twice,
# which is the rule working -- the boundary moves under the thumb wherever
# it is put, and 400 would collide with MATRIX_STATE_DEDUP_WINDOW_S).
# Sized by measurement, twice. At 250 the bench ran three Volume Up taps
# whose frame trains were 219, 213 and 215 ms -- every one folded to a
# single fire, but with only 30 ms of margin. A Volume Down tap in the same
# session ran 254 ms and fired twice, six milliseconds outside the window.
# 300 covers the whole measured spread of a deliberate tap and still sits
# far below a release-and-re-press, which cannot happen faster than about
# 150 ms and in practice is far slower.
#
# The other reason for 300: it is SIGNAL_REPEAT_SUPPRESS_MS. The Sniffer
# already counted one tap once while the trigger path counted it twice, and
# the two disagreeing about what a press was is exactly the fault this
# constant exists to fix. Three gates remain -- the Sniffer at 300, this at
# 300, the matrix at 400 -- and a unified capture stage is expected to
# supersede all three; until then these two at least agree.
#
# What it costs a held button: the cadence is whenever the first frame
# past the window arrives, so it follows the handset's own repeat rate.
# At the measured 100-110 ms that is one fire every 324 to 400 ms, between
# 2.5 and 3 a second (at 250 ms the bench measured seven fires across a
# two-second hold, 318 ms apart). A held volume button simply steps a
# little slower.
#
# Composes with MATRIX_STATE_DEDUP_WINDOW_S above: the mechanism is shared and
# the window is chosen per row. A row that is BOTH file-sourced and multi-frame
# keeps the wider 400 ms (its two frames can be 148 ms apart and it has no
# repeat behaviour to preserve); every other row gets this one. The wider
# window always wins where it applies.
