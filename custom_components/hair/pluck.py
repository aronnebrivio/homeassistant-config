"""Pluck orchestrator: vendor discovery + single-pluck session machinery.

A pluck routes a vendor "send learned code" service at the HAIR Tweezer and
captures the resulting infrared ``Command`` before it becomes physical IR.
The vendor call is awaited (``blocking=True``), so on the happy path the
captures land synchronously within the await; a short timeout is the safety
net. Plucks are serialized per config entry by a lock so exactly one Tweezer
session is open at a time.

# Replay plucking asks a vendor integration to send a code and catches
# it at the Tweezer. That covers appliance codebooks and cannot cover a
# Broadlink at all, because its remote.send_command transmits through
# its own hardware and will not aim at anything else. The codes are
# still there though, at rest, in the file the integration writes under
# .storage. So the second mechanism reads them.
#
# Everything below is orchestration. The reading itself lives in
# learned_code_stores.py, which is pure and knows nothing about hass,
# and the placing lives in SignalMonitor.import_learned_store, which
# owns the catalog lock. Both file reads run in an executor: they are
# blocking disk I/O and the event loop does not do that (GH #72 is the
# expensive version of forgetting).
