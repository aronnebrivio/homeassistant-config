/**
 * Validate for Perfect Fit (Second Fitting v3, coding plan Commit 5).
 *
 * The ceremony this whole family exists for, promoted to its own
 * dialog and its own route: prove every code, then sign it. Retired
 * out of `ir-save-wig-dialog` -- the one dialog that used to carry
 * every verb plus this ceremony beside them -- because the decision
 * window (Commit 3) already asks which route the person wants before
 * any dialog opens, so this one only ever does its own job now. Save
 * as New and Update Closet Wig (Commit 4) went the same way; this
 * commit retires the combined dialog they were all extracted from.
 *
 * The checklist, TEST, the "Changes with new fitting" section, the
 * signing and arming rules, the successor-rows denominator -- all of
 * it rides over from v2 UNCHANGED (spec section 4: "exactly as v2
 * section 1 specified"). What changes is what happens on SAVE and
 * after it:
 *
 * - SOURCED, DIVERGED. Owner ruling: "ALWAYS replaces." The save
 *   sends `replace: true` (Commit 2's server flag) in the SAME call
 *   that writes the successor, so the ancestor mints and retires in
 *   one step -- no post-save confirm, no Keep Both anywhere in this
 *   flow, because picking this route and signing the oath already
 *   was the decision. Second Fitting v3 punch list item 13 moved
 *   what retired (named fittings, the same graded weight the old
 *   self-supersede confirm gave it) and what would be lost to BEFORE
 *   the click instead -- see _gradedLine / _lostRowsLine -- because
 *   that is where the decision still is. The closing screen is now a
 *   pure one-line notification when this route replaced something;
 *   no top-up offer lives there anymore, since a device wanting the
 *   successor's new commands picks them up through the adopt path.
 * - SOURCED, MATCHING. Today's attested UPDATE: the bundle appends,
 *   nothing retires.
 * - FROM-SCRATCH. Today's attested CREATE: a wig is born signed,
 *   nothing to retire.
 *
 * THE TEST BUTTON IS STATELESS ABOUT PROOF, unchanged from v2: it
 * transmits through the device's own emitter routing and reports that
 * the code went over the air, never that the fan spun. "Heard" means
 * a receiver caught the signal, not a verdict -- that stays the
 * human's act.
 *
 * Bench fix (2026-08-07): the form and the receipt(s) used to be
 * separate <ha-dialog> elements, swapped on save. As of HA 2026.7,
 * <ha-dialog> opens a real native <dialog> (showModal()) under the
 * hood, and removing one mid-transition to open another raced the
 * outgoing close() against the incoming showModal() -- an uncaught
 * "InvalidStateError: Transition was aborted", reproduced live
 * against the test instance, that took the whole dialog off-screen
 * before the receipt ever painted (the save itself always succeeded;
 * only the confirmation was crashing invisibly). One <ha-dialog> now
 * stays open for the component's whole life; only the content inside
 * it swaps between the form and whichever receipt applies. The
 * sibling <ir-claims-ledger> below -- a genuinely separate native
 * <dialog>, opened only from the form -- is untouched.
