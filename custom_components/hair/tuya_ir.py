"""Read Tuya compressed IR codes (UFO-R11 and friends).

WHAT THE CONTAINER IS. A Tuya IR blaster stores a code as base64 of a
FastLZ level-1 compressed stream. Inflated, that stream is a plain
little-endian uint16 array of microsecond durations, alternating mark
and space and starting on a mark. There is no carrier field: 38 kHz is
the assumption, the same one the Broadlink reader makes.

WHY IT NEEDED READING. SmartIR files for MQTT controllers declare
``commandsEncoding: "Raw"``, which in SmartIR means a decimal timing
list. A UFO-R11 file says the same thing and carries this instead. GH
#108 is what came of believing the label: the digits inside base64 text
were read as microseconds and became codes that transmit nothing. So the
container is detected by CONTENT here, never by what the file calls it.

WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a Tuya writer, and it is not needed to send:
``mqtt.infrared`` shipped in HA 2026.8, so a Zigbee2MQTT-attached
UFO-R11 is an ordinary infrared-platform emitter HAIR already discovers.
Reading completes the path: once a code is timings, it is Pronto, and
Pronto goes out of any emitter and decodes like any capture.

WRITTEN FROM THE FORMAT, NOT FROM ANYONE'S SOURCE. FastLZ level 1 is a
short, well-documented byte format and the decoder below was written
from that description, in the same spirit as the decoders package rule:
HAIR carries no copied implementation.

  * A control byte under 0x20 opens a literal run of ``ctrl + 1`` bytes,
    which follow it verbatim.
  * Otherwise the top three bits are a match length and the low five are
    the high bits of a back reference. A length of 7 means "read one
    more byte and add it". One more byte carries the low eight bits of
    the reference. The match is ``length + 2`` bytes copied from
    ``reference + 1`` bytes back, byte at a time so overlapping runs
    expand the way the compressor intended.

Everything is bounds-checked before it is read, the output is capped,
and any malformed stream returns None rather than raising, looping or
allocating without limit. A corrupt payload is an unreadable code, which
is an ordinary outcome on an import path, not an exception.

      there is nothing ambiguous: a plaintext array beginning 806 us
      encodes as bytes ``26 03``, and refusing it because 0x26 is also
      the Broadlink IR type byte would refuse a perfectly good code.
      The reverse mistake -- letting the Broadlink parser have it -- is
      the misroute hazard the store reader's rule zero exists to
      prevent.
    - Base64 padding is repaired rather than validated, matching the
      Broadlink store path and HA core's own ``data_packet`` helper.

    The trailing capture-timeout gap that ends every stored Tuya code
    (0xFBD0, 64464 us) needs no special threshold: the array ends on a
