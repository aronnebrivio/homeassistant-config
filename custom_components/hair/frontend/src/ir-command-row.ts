/**
 * One row in the device-detail command checklist.
 * - Captured commands show protocol info plus Test / Delete actions and an action-mapping label.
 * - Unlearned templates show a single Learn button.
 *
 * TWO-LINE ANATOMY (command-row-restructure.md, commit 1 of 2, rides
 * 0.9.8): the row used to be a 3-column grid (status | info | actions)
 * where "info" stacked the name above whatever .meta held (a plain
 * protocol:code label, "not learned," or -- for a PRONTO command -- a
 * S/L diamond pattern that can wrap to several lines for a long
 * AC/matrix code). That variable-height diamond stack was the actual
 * bug: the drag grip in the status column sat vertically centered
 * against the row's full height, so on a tall row it drifted well
 * below the name it's supposed to sit beside.
 *
 * The fix is a deliberately minimal rearrangement, not a redesign:
 * every control below keeps its exact component, styling, hover
 * state, and behavior from before this pass -- only DOM position
 * changes, and only the grip's. Line one (.top-line) is a flex row
 * that always stays whatever height the name needs: grip, then the
 * name (with its rename pencil) in .name-line, then the SAME
 * .actions cluster as before this pass -- protocol chip, edit,
 * mapping label, TEST, TRIGGER, delete -- pushed to the far right via
 * margin-left: auto (owner ruling 2026-08-09: the chip and label
 * stay put on the right; only the grip moves). Line two (.meta) is
 * what used to be nested under the name -- diamonds, the plain
 * label, or "not learned" -- now a full-width block of its own
 * underneath, indented to align under the name's first letter, so a
 * long diamond pattern wraps in its own space without ever touching
 * line one's height. flex-wrap on .top-line is the whole answer to
 * narrow widths (RULED: no container queries, no collapse logic this
 * pass -- the wrap itself is the win).
 *
 * EDIT GLYPH + ACTION-MAPPING LABEL (edit-and-actions-coding-plan.md,
 * 2026-08-11, device-detail bench pilot): the edit button now renders
 * via the shared renderEditBtn helper (ir-icons.ts) rather than a
 * local ICON_COPY button. BENCH RULING (2026-08-11, first look at
 * VM999): the button moved again -- immediately left of the trash
 * can, matching edit-button-pass.md's general position rule for
 * every other surface -- after the initial pass kept it in the
 * pre-existing restructured slot per the standing sequencing ruling
 * and the owner found it read too small and too far from delete on
 * the actual bench. This also means commit 3's five-surface rollout
 * now matches this row's position exactly, so there is no longer a
 * device-detail exception to carry forward. The mapping badge is a
 * link-style label, not a button: blue "-> action name" when mapped,
 * muted gray "Map action" when empty. mobile-polish.md 2.2's
 * hide-when-equal rule (skip the label when the mapped action's name
 * equals the command name) shipped in the first bench pass and was
 * DROPPED the same day (owner ruling 2026-08-11, second look at
 * VM999): most self-descriptive command names (Power On, Volume Up,
 * Mute) are mapped to an action of the same name, so hiding on match
 * thinned out most of the list rather than the occasional row --
 * every mapped command now shows what it is mapped to, unconditionally.
 * THIRD bench ruling (2026-08-11): the label lost the word "Map" --
 * it now reads plain "Action" empty / "-> action name" mapped
 * (cmdrow.map_action_label; devdetail.map_action, the popover's own
 * title, is a separately-translated string left untouched this pass)
 * -- and gained a bit of trailing margin so it does not crowd TEST.
 * A "returning arrow" glyph the owner recalled from an earlier comp,
 * to replace the plain "->" here, was not found in either spec doc
 * (edit-and-actions-coding-plan.md, mobile-polish.md 2.2 -- both say
 * only "small arrow glyph"); left as-is pending the owner tracking
 * that comp down.
 * FOURTH bench ruling (2026-08-11): edit glyph 20px -> 22px, still
 * catching up to the trash can's visual weight (see ir-icons.ts).
 * Edit and trash now sit in their own .edit-trash-group wrapper with
 * a zero gap, so their hover boxes butt directly against each other
 * rather than sitting the shared .actions gap (4px) apart. The
 * action-mapping label's fixed-width reservation (actionBadgeLabel /
 * actionBadgeFontPx) is reinstated -- dropped in commit 2 on the
 * theory that a plain label was free to change width row to row, but
 * the owner wants every row's action column, and everything after
 * it, landing at the same x position, same as the old bordered
 * .badge-btn did (git 159b6b3^) before the link-A swap.
 * FIFTH bench ruling (2026-08-11): settles the empty-state glyph
 * question left open after the "U-turn" comp didn't turn up
 * anywhere searchable (checked the repo's own screenshot assets,
 * images/screenshots/action-mapping.png and neighbors -- all three
 * predate the link-A redesign) -- a plain "+" before "Action"
 * instead, same muted gray as the rest of the empty state
 * (.map-plus).
 * The remaining mobile-polish.md 2.2 items (pencil removal, hairline,
 * TEST vs SEND) stay queued for their own pass.
 *
 * CLIMATE PRESET STAR (climate-presets-star-handoff.md, owner-approved
 * 2026-08-17): AC rows gain one more member of .actions, between
 * TRIGGER and the edit/trash pair -- a star that toggles the command
 * into a Home Assistant preset on the device's climate entity, named
 * exactly what the row is named. Grey outline at rest, solid #4dabf7
 * once starred, edit's own hover wash in either state; no gold
 * anywhere (the plan's original #f5a623 is retired, not parked). It
 * reuses .edit-btn's box wholesale rather than copying its numbers
 * (see renderStarBtn in ir-icons.ts), and it sits INSIDE
 * .edit-trash-group, butted against the pencil at zero gap like the
 * pencil is against the can -- owner bench ruling 2026-08-17, which
 * supersedes the handoff's "deliberately NOT fused" line: on the box
 * the 4px read as the star drifting away from a tight pair. The
 * group's own 4px from TRIGGER is untouched. One click toggles, no
 * dialog.

           pressable. MAPPED is accent blue with a small arrow glyph
           ("-> turn on"); EMPTY is muted gray ("Action"). Shows
           unconditionally when mapped (owner ruling 2026-08-11, second
           bench look) -- an earlier pass hid the label when the mapped
           name equalled the command name, but that collapsed most of

           FIXED WIDTH, CENTERED (owner ruling 2026-08-11, fourth bench
           look): reinstates the pre-commit-2 badge-button's own
           technique (git 159b6b3^, .badge-btn/.badge-sizer) rather than
           inventing a new one -- .action-sizer and .action-visible are
           both direct children stacked in the SAME grid cell
           (grid-area: 1/1 below), so the (invisible) sizer's width sets
           the column's width in the font actually rendered, and the
           visible content centers within it. actionBadgeLabel /
           actionBadgeFontPx (ir-device-detail.ts) already computed the
           widest label this device type's action list can produce and
           its font tier; only the reservation on THIS side was missing
           since commit 2 dropped the old badge-button markup. The sizer
           always includes the arrow, since a row can go from unmapped
           to mapped without changing width -- see
           ir-device-detail.ts's _measureActionBadges for the matching
           box-model rework (no more padding/border chrome, an arrow's
           width instead). */
