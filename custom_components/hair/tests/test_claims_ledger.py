"""The ledger: everything a reader can honestly say about attestations.

It replaced a tab inside the fitting dialog, and the point of the
replacement is what these tests assert. The old tab sat next to
controls that could edit the rows it was reporting on. The new one is a
pure read whose whole payload is derived from the file, which buys two
properties the old one could not have:

- It cannot lie about staleness, because there is no stored state to go
  stale. A row edited after somebody proved it reports as orphaned the
  next time anybody opens the dialog.
- It cannot disagree with the closet row's check, because both ask the
  same predicate (``bundle_is_complete``).

The third thing tested here is the honesty of the ORPHAN. A claim about
a row that no longer exists is not deleted and not counted as coverage.
Somebody really did prove that recipe; it just is not the recipe on the
file any more, and either hiding it or crediting it would misdescribe
what the wig has behind it.
