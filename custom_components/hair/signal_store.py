    """Collapse one remote's duplicate signals in a single O(n) pass.

    The Clipper's manual paste path historically had no guard, so a
    remote could hold two truly identical signals (the same Pronto
    pasted twice); and boundary protocols (Sony) minted
    flip-duplicates -- same byte_hash, DIFFERENT S/L fingerprint --
    under the pre-unified runtime dedup. Signals collapse under the
    tiered identity rule (decoded > byte_hash > S/L fingerprint),
    merging each duplicate's hit count into the first (older)
    occurrence and keeping that row's alias (adopting the duplicate's
    alias only when the kept row has none). Two signals that share an
    S/L fingerprint but differ at the byte level (Panasonic, TCL, Sony
    siblings) are distinct and are NOT collapsed.

    GH #72 rewrite: the old pass rescanned every kept row per signal
    (quadratic; 1.46e9 pair comparisons on the reporter's store) and
    built a SignalIdentity per pair. This pass keys dicts on the
    identity values instead and reproduces the old scan's outcome
    exactly. Per ``SignalIdentity.match_tier``, the highest tier BOTH
    sides carry decides, a decided-tier mismatch is final (no
    fallthrough), and a tier either side lacks is skipped; the old
    scan then kept the strongest-tier match, first (oldest) kept row
    winning within a tier. Hence:

    - Tier 1: every candidate shares the signal's decoded
      fingerprint, so the first kept row under that key in
      ``dec_first`` IS the old scan's answer.
    - Tier 2 applies only to pairs that do not BOTH carry decoded
      identity. When the incoming signal carries one, a kept row with
      any decoded fingerprint is unreachable at tier 2 (equal decoded
      matched at tier 1; different decoded is a final mismatch), so
      the eligible rows are exactly the byte_hash matches lacking
      decoded identity (``byte_nod``). When the signal lacks decoded
      identity, every byte_hash match is eligible (``byte_all``).
    - Tier 3 mirrors that logic against both stronger layers
      (``fp_all`` / ``fp_nod`` / ``fp_nob`` / ``fp_nodb``).

    Each dict stores only the FIRST kept row per key (setdefault):
    within a tier the first-inserted eligible row is the match, so
    later kept rows with the same key can never be the answer.
