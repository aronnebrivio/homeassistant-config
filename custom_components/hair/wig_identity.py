"""Wig-signal identity: derive live identity from a wig's raw Pronto.

The shared helper of fitting-flow.md 5.1 and closet-direct-to-device.md
4.1: a wig file carries raw Pronto and NO decoded fields (wig_format
rule), so anything that wants to transmit or match a wig signal must
derive fingerprint, byte-hash, and decoded identity fresh on this
install. Fitting builds this; direct-to-device consumes it.

Derivation is deliberately NOT bespoke: the Pronto is normalized by the
same validator every import path uses, converted to raw timings by the
same ``ProntoCommand`` the transmit path uses, and pushed through the
same ``signal_monitor.normalize()`` the Sniffer and Plucker share. A
wig signal therefore resolves to byte-identical identity values as the
same signal captured off the air, which is what lets a fitting send
claim its own Mirror echo and lets direct-to-device dedup against the
catalog.
