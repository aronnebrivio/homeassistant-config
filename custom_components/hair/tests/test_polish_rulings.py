Every assertion here stands for a defect found on the bench that the

promising a click the surface refuses, a reserved slot that was never
reserved. They read the TypeScript rather than run it, which is the

    drags everything before it sideways: a library row with no DELETE
    sat 64px right of a local one and the download icons never lined up
    down the list (owner bench 2026-08-02).

    The ghost that used to hold DELETE's place rendered the real
    localized label, so the reservation stayed correct in any language.
    That was sound reasoning right up until the polish pass made DELETE
    an icon: a text-width ghost against an 18px can would have re-broken
    the very alignment it was added to fix, inverted. A fixed 30px slot
    is locale-proof by construction, so the ghost is gone and the trash
    was the fourth slot. The invariant is unchanged; only the mechanism.

    Edit-and-actions Commit 3 (2026-08-11, owner-approved five-surface
    rollout) moved edit out of its own leading slot to sit flush against
    trash instead, matching every other surface's edit-trash-group
    pairing. Comb kept its own 30px .glyph-slot at that point.

    The download-button pass (2026-08-11) moved download a second time,
    out of its own .glyph-slot and into the SAME edit-trash-group,
    between edit and trash (owner ruling: "place it between the edit
    and delete buttons"). Unlike edit and trash, download is NOT
    conditional on row.wig -- library rows can download too -- so a
    plain flex-end-packed group would slide it flush against the right
    edge on library rows (where it is the group's only content) instead
    of holding the middle position it has on local rows, reintroducing
    the exact column-drift bug this row already has one fix for. Each
    of the three buttons gets its own fixed 24px .icon-slot instead, so
    download's x-position never moves.

    The comb-relocation pass (2026-08-12, owner ruling: "move that comb
    glyph over to after the signals listing next to the name") moved
    comb a second time too, this time OUT of .row-actions entirely and
    into the row's ordinary left-to-right flow, between .wig-count and
    .fit-tick. .glyph-slot's fixed-width reservation existed only to
    protect .row-actions's right-anchored contents from drifting when
    something conditional was missing; comb isn't in that group anymore
    so it doesn't need the reservation, the same way .wig-model and
    .fit-tick already sit unwrapped earlier in the row with no drift
    issue. .glyph-slot itself -- CSS rule and markup both -- is gone.
