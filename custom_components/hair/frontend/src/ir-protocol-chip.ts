/**
 * The protocol chip (Highlights, GH #78) -- one pill, five homes.
 *
 * A signal either transmits as its decoded protocol rebuilt clean, or as
 * the bytes that were captured. The chip says which, and where it is
 * interactive it is also how you change it.
 *
 * Owner rulings baked in (2026-08-01):
 * - TWO states, not three. The protocol name, or BYPASS. A row that
 *   decoded nothing renders NO CHIP AT ALL, which is what it already did
 *   before this existed.
 * - ONE pill everywhere. Same geometry, same colours, in every location.
 *   Read-only surfaces differ only by `cursor: default` and no hover. An
 *   earlier draft used a second, greyer chip for static contexts to
 *   signal un-clickability; that was rejected, correctly, because it
 *   makes one fact look like two things depending on the screen.
 * - The protocol name never goes inside translated copy. It is a proper
 *   noun that can legitimately be absent, so interpolating it would
 *   leave a hole in the translation. The sentence stands alone and the
 *   name is appended after a middot.
 *
 * This settles the static-pill decision parked on 2026-06-21.
