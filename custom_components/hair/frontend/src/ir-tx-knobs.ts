/**
 * The TX-knob glyphs: whole-frame send count and NEC ditto count.
 *
 * One component, four homes (owner ruling, 2026-08-01). These glyphs
 * had been hand-copied into the device command rows and the Mirror
 * rows, and were simply absent from the Sniffer and Clipper signal
 * rows -- so a user could set a send count on a catalog signal, save
 * it, and see no trace of it anywhere on the row they had just edited.
 * Reported from the bench as "maybe that's an oversight we have
 * systemically", which it was.
 *
 * Both glyphs are conditional in the same way they always were:
 * - the repeat glyph appears only above 1, because "sends once" is the
 *   default and drawing it would put a badge on every row in the list
 * - the ditto glyph additionally requires a decoded identity, since
 *   dittos are an NEC-family frame construct and mean nothing on a row
 *   that only ever replays captured timings
 * - and it is suppressed entirely on a bypassed row. Raw replay sends
 *   the captured bytes verbatim, so the dittos never reach the wire and
 *   a glyph claiming otherwise would misdescribe the transmission. That
 *   rule already existed on the device command rows; folding it in here
 *   is what extends it to the three surfaces that lacked it.
 *
 * The tooltip keys are properties rather than constants because the
 * hosts word the same fact differently and correctly: a command "sends
 * this command N times", a catalog signal "sends this signal N times".
 * Passing the key in keeps both sentences, and their ten translations,
 * exactly as they are.

/**

 *
 * Measured against infrared-protocols rather than assumed (owner call,
 * 2026-08-02), by counting the timings each protocol emits as
 * repeat_count goes 0, 1, 3:
 *
 *   NEC         67 -> 71 -> 79    a 4-entry ditto frame. The real thing.
 *   Samsung32   67 -> 135 -> 271  duplicates the entire frame
 *   RC-5        21 -> 43 -> 87    duplicates the entire frame
 *   Sharp       64 -> 64 -> 64    ignores repeat_count
 *   Sony        26 -> 26 -> 26    ignores repeat_count
 *
 * Only the first is a ditto. The two that duplicate are doing what
 * send_count already does, except from inside the content hash, where
 * a delivery detail has no business being; the two that ignore it
 * would hash a number that never reaches the wire. So the knob is
 * NEC-only everywhere it appears.
