"""Tests for pinned-remote retransmit (signpost 4, Track 2).

Two things are under test and they are worth naming separately. The
DISPATCH POLICY (coalescing) is the interesting half: it exists so a
held button cannot build a queue that outlives the finger, and the
"never lands after the press stops" property is what bench case 3
checks in the room. The WIRING half is smaller but load-bearing: the
retransmit must ride the confirmed fire, never the raw hit, and must
never replace the trigger's event.
