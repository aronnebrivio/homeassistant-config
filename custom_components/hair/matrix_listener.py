"""The hear side of a climate matrix (signpost 4, Track M).

A Remote minted from a matrix wig (or through either mirror door)
carries a COPY of the lattice, keyed by its own id in the same
``hair/matrices/`` folder the device side uses. The device's matrix is
the one it SENDS from; the remote's is the one it HEARS on. This module
owns the remote side of that file: reading it, holding it, matching
captured frames against its cells, and recording what was heard.

WHY THIS IS NOT A TRIGGER LOOKUP. A lattice is thousands of states, and
the lattice never auto-mints rows (the matrix rule) -- so cells cannot
live in ``IRTrigger`` or in ``get_triggers_for_signal`` without turning
a linear scan over a handful of triggers into a scan over thousands of
cells on every capture. Instead each matrix remote gets its own reverse
index, built once from its file and consulted right after the trigger
match, under the same not-echo gate. A cell that a user deliberately
promotes to a trigger is a plain trigger from that moment and matches
through the ordinary path; this listener stays the always-on reading of
the whole lattice.

IDENTITY TIERS, the one that is deliberately missing, and the one added
last. Cells are indexed by decoded fingerprint, by ``(S/L fingerprint,
byte_hash)``, and by ``byte_hash`` alone -- the order
``HAIRStore.match_command`` and ``pin_bindings`` already use. The
bare-fingerprint tier is NOT built here at all. AC frames are long state
blobs whose S/L patterns are near neighbours across a whole branch, so a
fingerprint-only match would report the wrong cell -- and reporting the
wrong state is worse than reporting none, because a wrong state is a
plausible lie the card would show with full confidence.

Beneath those sits the receiver-tolerant tier (2026-08-18), because the
byte hash does not survive a real air path for a lattice code: twenty
presses of one Mitsubishi cell through a microsecond-accurate
transmitter gave twenty byte hashes, none of them the file's. A cell is
always file-sourced, so every cell is indexed there; the gates are that
the CAPTURE must have decoded as nothing, and that a normalized value
two genuinely different cells claim is dropped rather than answered.
identity.py's normalized-fingerprint block carries the measurement.

THE INDEX BUILDS IN THE BACKGROUND, ONCE. Deriving identity per cell
runs the same decode the Sniffer runs: measured on the bench,
3.7 ms/cell on a Mitsubishi lattice and 0.8 ms/cell on a Gree one (the
cost tracks frame length, not cell count), so the census worst case of
2,689 cells is seconds of work. The build is dispatched as a task and
the frames that arrive meanwhile simply do not match (logged once per
remote); awaiting it on the capture path would delay a capture by
seconds to save one press.

That cost is paid ONCE, not once per boot: the built index is written
beside the matrix file as ``<id>.index.json`` and reloaded on the next
start, so restarts are instant. The stored index names the matrix it
came from by content hash and records the display unit its names were
built in, so a rewritten lattice or a flipped unit system rebuilds
instead of being believed. Every door that writes, copies or deletes a
matrix drops the index too.

AND IT IS PAID AT SETUP, NOT ON THE FIRST FRAME (0.10.1 item 3). The
lazy path above still exists, but nothing should ever need it at boot:
``async_warm_indexes`` runs once during setup, strictly before any
receiver is subscribed, so the first press after a restart matches.
Reading a stored index is 6 to 12 ms, which sounds like a race nobody
loses -- but a single-frame file-sourced code pressed in the first
moments after boot fell inside it, and a two-frame press only matched
because its SECOND frame arrived after the read. The lazy path stays as
the fallback for a remote minted at runtime, and the mint doors warm
their new lattice themselves so even that one rarely runs.
