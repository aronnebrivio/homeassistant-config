"""Trigger manager for HAIR.

Tracks per-trigger hit counts and fires HA event entities when the
configured ``min_hits`` threshold is reached within the reset window.

v0.5.7 (location-aware triggers): each capture is threaded with the
receiver that observed it. Triggers gain an optional receiver scope
(``matches_receiver``); the fire payload carries the receiver entity plus
its resolved area. A single physical press captured by several receivers
within the fire dedup window counts once per trigger so multi-receiver
setups do not double-count toward ``min_hits`` or double-fire. (The key
was per (trigger, fingerprint) when this was written; v0.5.8 made it
trigger-global under tiered identity -- see the dedup comment in
``on_signal_captured`` -- and this line had gone stale.)

        Used when an edit changes a signal/command's identity. Identity is

        (v0.5.8): a sub-threshold edit (Sony code A to Sony code B) changes
        ONLY the byte_hash, so this must run on ANY component changing, not
        just the fingerprint. Callers capture ``old_byte_hash`` and
        ``old_decoded_fingerprint`` BEFORE mutating the signal/command.

        Repoint rule: a trigger on the old fingerprint is rewired when its
        byte-level and decoded identities are each either unknown on one
        side or equal -- precise for scoped triggers, broad for legacy
        ones; a trigger scoped to a DIFFERENT sibling identity is left

        (``new_byte_hash``, ``new_decoded_fingerprint``), which promotes
        legacy triggers to precise identity; the edit gives us certain
        knowledge of the new identity, so this is a strict improvement.
        (Note the tiered matcher itself would keep an unstamped trigger
        firing across a fingerprint-only change via byte_hash, but stamping
        keeps stored identity honest rather than relying on the rescue.)

        the shape for callers but is always empty now that collisions are legal.
