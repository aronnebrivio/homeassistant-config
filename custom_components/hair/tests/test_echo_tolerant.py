"""The echo ticket's tolerant fallback (owner ruling 2026-08-18).

Finding B of the Remote Buffing dress rehearsal: setting a pinned matrix
Device's dial put three frames back through the Athom, the fuzzy garble
guard swallowed two, and the third was heard as a handset press and
fired the state trigger. The ticket claimed nothing because both
identities it held were computed from the FILE, which is not what a
receiver hands back.

Captures are the bench's own -- see ``fixtures/air-path/README.md``.
