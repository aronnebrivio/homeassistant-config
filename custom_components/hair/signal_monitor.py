"""Always-on IR signal monitor for HAIR.

Supports two receive paths:

1. **Native (HA 2026.6+):** subscribes to each ``InfraredReceiverEntity``
   via ``infrared.async_subscribe_receiver()``.  Hardware-agnostic --
   any integration implementing the receiver entity works automatically.
2. **Legacy (HA 2026.4-2026.5):** falls back to listening for
   ``esphome.remote_received`` events on the HA event bus.  Requires
   the ESPHome YAML bridge (``on_pronto`` + ``homeassistant.event``).

Groups observed signals by source device and surfaces unknown IR
activity for user assignment.
