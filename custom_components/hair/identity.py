"""Tiered signal identity -- the one shared answer to "same signal?".

Unified signal identity (v0.5.8, second half). Three identity layers
exist for every captured signal, from most to least precise:

1. ``decoded_fingerprint`` -- the protocol library decoded the signal
   (NEC today on live captures; more protocols as upstream decoders
   land). Immune to timing jitter. The permanent answer.
2. ``byte_hash`` -- quantized timing words (20-unit bins), present on
   essentially every Pronto capture. Robust to the jitter that breaks
   the S/L fingerprint (Sony's long mark sits exactly ON the 48-unit
   S/L threshold, so the same button flips fingerprints between
   captures; its byte_hash survives the round trip exactly).
3. ``signal_fingerprint`` (S/L) -- the coarse short/long pattern.
   Retained for records that carry nothing better (non-Pronto legacy
   protocol/code pairs, pre-byte_hash data).

Match rule: two signals are the same when the highest tier they BOTH
carry agrees. A tier that only one side carries is skipped (never
fatal); a tier both sides carry decides (a mismatch there does NOT
fall through to a lower tier). This is a strict generalization of the
byte_hash trigger-identity rule: the only new truth-table cell is
"fingerprint mismatch + byte_hash match", which used to be a miss and
is now a match. No previously-working match can regress.

Every identity consumer (trigger matching, the known-command matcher,
Sniffer dedup, repeat suppression, the Assign-dot index) goes through
this module so the rule cannot drift between call sites.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE CANONICAL FORM: identity is computed on the WIRE Pronto, never the
# file Pronto (owner ruling 2026-08-17, one authoritative form)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A Pronto that came out of a FILE and the same code coming back off a
# RECEIVER are not the same string, so hashing them gives different
# identities. The mechanism is the trailing gap word:
#
#   file  ... 002E 0011 0F1C     <- the inter-frame gap, as written
#   wire  ... 002E 0011 0000     <- what a capture rebuilds to
#
# Every capture is rebuilt from raw timings through ``raw_to_pronto``,
# and ``ProntoCommand.get_raw_timings`` strips the trailing space on the
# way out (the 0.9.8 identity rule, GH #98 terminator handling). One
# word is enough: both the S/L fingerprint and the byte hash move with
# it. So identity derived from file text can never match a real press.
#
# This is not theoretical. Measured on the bench closet, 2026-08-17:
#
#   - 469 of 943 flat wig signals change identity across that round
#     trip. 348 of them are rescued by the decoded tier, which is
#     computed from timings and so is form-independent. The remaining
#     121 are undecoded and MISSED ENTIRELY -- a Remote minted from
#     such a wig sat there with its triggers never firing (reproduced
#     on the bench with acer-rc-17de0: 16 triggers, 0 fires, until the
#     press was matched on the wire form).
#   - 80 of 272 Pronto commands on wig-adopted devices carry file-form
#     identity, 23 of them undecoded, so ``match_command`` did not
#     recognize the real remote's press and ``pin_bindings`` could not
#     map a capture-minted trigger onto them.
#
# Hence: canonicalize BEFORE hashing, everywhere. Mint doors, edit
# paths, both reverse indexes, and the matrix cell index all go through
# the three helpers below, so a second form cannot be reintroduced by
# adding a call site.
#
# What is NOT canonicalized is the stored Pronto TEXT. It stays exactly
# as written, because a wig's claim digests hash that text
# (``wig_format.row_digest``) and rewriting it would invalidate every
# fitting ever signed -- verified on the bench: the digest is stable
# across this change, and the digest OF the wire text differs. Identity
# fields move; the code a person can read and paste does not.
#
# Canonicalization is idempotent (verified over 1,411 closet codes:
# canonical(canonical(x)) == canonical(x)), which is what lets the
# load-time backfill run on every boot without churn.

# THE RECEIVER-TOLERANT TIER: a normalized fingerprint for file-sourced,
# undecoded codes (2026-08-18, from the air-path characterization run)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# WHAT THE MEASUREMENT SAID. A code HAIR knows only from a FILE -- a
# matrix cell, a wig-minted trigger or command, a Clipper paste, a
# Plucker pull -- does not match its own capture over a real air path on
# the byte-hash tier. Twenty presses of one Mitsubishi cell through the
# microsecond-accurate ESPHome transmitter produced twenty distinct byte
# hashes and not one of them was the code that was sent. Short flat
# codes hash stably but on a transmitter-specific wrong value: ESPHome
# and Broadlink each land on their own, and neither is the file's. The
# injector reproduces the file identity exactly in every case, so the
# identity code is right and the air is what moves.
#
# The distortion is the receiver's, not the transmitter's: marks come
# back short and spaces come back long (mean mark ratio 0.88 to 0.95 on
# ESPHome, 0.83 to 0.85 on Broadlink; spaces 1.00 to 1.12), the classic
# photodiode AGC signature, with per-edge excursions from 0.71 to 1.27 --
# more than enough to flip an individual S/L decision. Press to press
# the mean is very steady (spread 0.002 to 0.023), so the distortion is
# systematic rather than random.
#
# WHAT SURVIVES IT. Divide a capture's marks by its own median mark and
# its spaces by its own median space, and a systematic stretch cancels.
# Classify the normalized runs into two levels and hash the class
# sequence with the edge count: over 35 air captures of three codes from
# two transmitters, that value equalled the value computed from the FILE
# in 34 cases (the one miss is a Broadlink capture of C2, the worst
# transmitter). It is also distinct where it has to be: 34 distinct
# values for the 34 distinct codes of a 64-cell Mitsubishi lattice, and
# 16 for the 16 signals of an ACER RC-17DE0 wig.
#
# WHY THE LEVELS ARE FOUND, NOT THRESHOLDED. The obvious cheap version
# is to keep the existing S/L threshold and apply it to the normalized
# values. Measured on the same corpus, that collapses ALL SIXTEEN ACER
# codes onto one value, because a fixed multiple of the median lands on
# the wrong side of a protocol whose short and long runs are not spread
# the way NEC's are. Splitting at the widest RELATIVE gap in the code's
# own sorted runs (and only if that gap is at least 1.20x, so a run with
# no real separation stays one level) gives 16 of 16 on the same data.
# Two levels only: three and four levels were measured and buy nothing.
#
# WHY THE TIER IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. It is deliberately the LOWEST tier,
# reached only after decoded, (fingerprint, byte hash) and byte hash all
# miss, and only for records that are BOTH file-sourced and undecoded.
# A receiver-learned record already matches through its existing tiers,
# and handing it this one would re-collapse the sibling buttons the byte
# hash exists to separate: a sub-threshold remote (Sony and family)
# classifies every run the same way, so its whole keypad shares one
# normalized fingerprint. Measured across the bench closet, 53 buttons
# of one Sony wig share a single value -- which costs nothing there
# because every one of them decodes and never reaches this tier, and
# would cost a great deal on a keypad that does not.
#
# AMBIGUITY IS NOT A MATCH. Even inside the scope above, two genuinely
# different waveforms can share a normalized fingerprint: 13 groups out
# of 2,354 across the same closet, mostly long AC blobs whose runs sit
# in one cluster. An index therefore REFUSES a value claimed by two
# different codes rather than letting the last one win (NormFpIndex
# below). Reporting the wrong state is worse than reporting none, and
# that is a rule this file now enforces structurally instead of asking
# every call site to remember it.

# A run must sit at least this far above the next one down before the
# two count as different levels. Below it, the code has no real
# separation and stays one level.

# A space this many times the 90th-percentile space is an inter-frame

# WHOSE BYTES NEVER CAME THROUGH A RECEIVER (owner ruling 2026-08-18)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The tolerant tier is for records HAIR knows only from a file. A
# receiver-learned record already matches through its existing tiers,
# and handing it this one would re-collapse the sibling buttons the byte
# hash exists to separate.
#
# The ruling, verbatim in shape: a command is file-sourced when either
# (a) its own ``source`` says so -- the value a mint door stamped -- or
# (b) the owning device came from a file AND the command carries no
# decoded identity. (b) exists only for data written before the doors
# stamped anything, so an install that adopted a wig last month gains
# the tier without re-adopting; (a) is what every new mint uses.
#
# Wig-adopted and plucked commands are stamped IMPORTED rather than
# given a new enum value: ``CommandSource.IMPORTED`` already means "came
# from a file rather than off the air", nothing in the frontend renders
# it (the STATE chip is gated on "matrix" alone), and a fourth value
# would be a second name for the same fact.

    Read from what each mint door actually writes:

    - ``origin="closet"`` -- minted from a wig file by USE as a Remote.
      File-sourced by construction.
    - ``origin="matrix"`` -- saved off a lattice by Track M's own
      "+ Trigger" (the panel sends this one; ir-trigger-row paints its
      STATE chip on it). A lattice is always a file.
    - ``origin="device"`` -- minted from a HAIR device's commands, so
      the SOURCE COMMAND decides. A device minted from sniffed rows
      gives receiver-learned triggers; one adopted from a wig gives
      file-sourced ones.
    - ``origin="clip"`` / ``origin="plucked"`` -- minted
      from a Clipper paste or a Plucker pull. Both are files by
      definition: those bytes were pasted or read out of a vendor
      integration and never came off a receiver. Added 2026-08-18,
      after the regression bench proved the gap over air -- an Arris
      Power row pasted through the Clipper could not hear itself,
      because the byte hash moved, the bare-fingerprint tier is
      withheld from hash-bearing rows since v0.5.8, and the one tier
      that did match (norm_fp was identical) was never offered.
    - ``origin="remote"`` -- minted from a SNIFFED catalog
      remote's signals. Receiver-learned, so it stays off the tier.
      The only one of the three catalog sources that is.
    - ``origin="manual"`` / None -- the drawer's own dialog. Not
      file-sourced on its own.

    On top of the door, the owning Remote answers for the rows created
    ON it: a trigger saved from a matrix Remote's card or from its LAST
    HEARD row carries the origin of the dialog, not of the lattice, and
    a lattice is always a file. Same shape as the command rule's clause
    (b), including the no-decoded-identity condition.
