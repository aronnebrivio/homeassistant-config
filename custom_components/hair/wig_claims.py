"""Writing claims onto wigs: the CREATE and UPDATE export paths.

Two verbs, chosen by whether the device remembers a wig it came from.

**CREATE** mints a new wig from a device: a fresh identity, the
device's stated send counts, dittos and raw pins, provenance if it
grew from a converted seed, and optionally the author's first claims
bundle.

**UPDATE** appends a claims bundle to a wig that already exists and
**touches nothing else** (brief hard rule 3). Not the signals, not
their order, not their aliases, not their send counts. An attestation
PR should be readable at a glance as "one person vouched for these
rows" -- if updating also rewrote content, every attestation would
arrive looking like a content change and a maintainer would have to
diff it to find out. The round-trip test in test_wig_claims pins this:
adopt, then update, and the signals block comes back byte-identical.

The one deliberate exception is a rename the fitter explicitly asked
to propose, which writes the alias and nothing else. Names live
outside every digest, so writing one orphans no claims -- which is
what makes "suggest the rename" a plain PR rather than new machinery.

    adjudicate like any other prose change. No separate suggestion

    KEYED BY THE PAIR of digest AND current alias (amended 2026-08-02),
    because each alone is ambiguous in a different direction and both
    directions are real:

    - **Name alone** breaks when two rows share a name. Renaming one
      would move both.
    - **Digest alone** breaks when two rows share a payload under
      different labels -- and that is not a hypothetical. Distinct
      names over one identical code is the SmartIR defect class this
      whole repair pipeline was built for; the comb carries an advisory
      for it. Those wigs are exactly the converted ones people fit
      first, so digest-sharing rows are common precisely where this
      code runs most.

    The pair is unambiguous in both directions. It is also the identity
    ``RowClaim`` already uses -- alias_at_claim plus digest -- so a
    rename proposal and a claim point at a row the same way.

    A row that is a true duplicate of another in BOTH fields is
    indistinguishable by construction; there is no way to target one,
    so both move. That is the honest behaviour rather than a silent
    pick of the first.

    Pair-first matters because digest-only on its own has the

    code, the SmartIR defect class this pipeline exists for. Running
    the exact pass first means those rows are already claimed by their

    really is absent from the wig -- so the exclusion picker and the

    Residual ties in pass two are broken by file order, and that is

    the claim binds are identical. No tie-break can route the wrong
