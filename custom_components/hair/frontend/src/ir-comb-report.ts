/**
 * The comb report: what is wrong, ordered by what it DOES to you.
 *
 * The first draft grouped by check class and gave every class an
 * identical card. That is the backend's ordering rendered faithfully,
 * and it made a wig with nine cosmetic artefacts look exactly as
 * alarming as one with a code that answers a press and sets the wrong
 * state. The severity ranking existed; it just was not visible in the
 * first two seconds, which is the only part most people read.
 *
 * So the report leads with CONSEQUENCE. Three buckets, worst present
 * first, and an empty bucket does not render at all -- a card reading
 * "0 will do the wrong thing" is reassurance wearing the costume of a
 * warning.
 *
 * The tally carries a DENOMINATOR. Forty-eight findings is
 * catastrophic on a seven-button remote and unremarkable on a 288-cell
 * lattice, and it is the same number either way.
 *
 * Inside a bucket, one row per check class, opening on a chevron into
 * the findings GROUPED BY DIAGNOSIS. Frame shape on the Samsung has
 * twenty-two findings and two facts in it: nineteen codes send one
 * burst pair too many, three send two too many. Printing the same
 * sentence nineteen times was never nineteen facts.
 *
 * The footer line is load bearing rather than decoration: combing and
 * fitting are orthogonal, and "it passed a fitting" will otherwise be
 * read as "the codes are all good". The findings measured that -- the
 * dimension checklist caught one defective cell in 74.

               The report arrives in two paints: a short "combing..."
               box, then the full thing once the comb returns, which on
               a 750-cell lattice is a couple of hundred milliseconds.
               Centred, that reads as one window appearing and a second
               one landing on top of it (bench 2026-08-03). Anchored,
               it simply grows downward from a fixed top edge.
               It also stops a tall report being clipped: the buckets on
               a big matrix run past a laptop viewport, and a centred
               flex child with nowhere to scroll loses both ends.
               Second Fitting v3 punch list item 20: the top edge
               itself moves to a computed near-center instead of a
               flat 5vh, so the common report -- well under 620px, the
               TYPICAL REPORT HEIGHT -- reads centred on any screen,
               while a big matrix report still starts at this same
               calm position and grows downward into the scroll above,
               exactly as the anchoring rationale above requires. No
               recentre jump either way: the top edge is fixed once
               computed, paint two just adds height below it. The
               100dvh repeat is the mobile-safe fallback -- browsers
               without dvh support simply keep the vh line above it. */
