/**
 * The row-level trash button, shared by all nine surfaces that draw
 * one, so there is one can and one behaviour rather than nine.
 *
 * GREY AT REST, EMBER ON HOVER (owner ruling 2026-08-03). Ember is
 * already the panel's delete colour on every text chip, so the icon
 * inherits the meaning rather than introducing a second one. Material
 * red is deliberately held back: nothing in HAIR is unrecoverable
 * enough to earn it, and every one of these sits behind a confirm
 * dialog anyway.
 *
 * The hover wash is 0.12 where the text chip uses 0.08. A smaller hit
 * target needs a slightly stronger cue to read as the same weight.
 *
 * NO rest-state opacity multiplier (owner bugfix ruling 2026-08-12,
 * user reports of the buttons reading as nearly invisible on a light
 * theme). `--disabled-text-color` is already a theme-correct muted
 * tone -- HA computes it separately for light and dark so it has
 * adequate contrast against each theme's own card background.
 * Layering a flat `opacity: 0.55` on top doesn't dim the COLOR, it
 * blends the rendered pixel toward whatever is behind it: on a dark
 * card that still reads as a visible light-grey icon, but on a white
 * or near-white card the same blend washes out toward white, which
 * is exactly the "too light to see" report. Every button in this
 * file that shares this anatomy (trash/settings/edit/download) had
 * the same multiplier and the same bug; all four had it removed
 * together. The hover and :disabled opacities are untouched --
 * :disabled's 0.25 is a real backdrop-independent "this doesn't
 * work" cue, not a rest-state color choice, so it stays.
 *
 * HOVER WASH STRENGTH, ROUND 2 (owner bugfix ruling 2026-08-12, same
 * session): the rgba() background washes on hover have the identical
 * problem the rest-state opacity did -- their visible strength is
 * whatever the alpha blend produces against the card behind them, not
 * a fixed, guaranteed contrast. Trash's ember (230, 81, 0) survived at
 * 12% alpha by luck of the hue: orange is dark and saturated enough
 * that even diluted, it reads as a tint on white. Edit/settings'
 * light pastel blue (100, 181, 246) is already close to white in
 * luminance, so the same 12% diluted it to within a few RGB units of
 * white -- no visible box, just the icon itself turning blue (owner
 * report: "doesn't get a box... just turns the whole glyph blue").
 * All four washes bumped from 12%/16% to a uniform 20% so the box
 * reads reliably on a light card without needing per-hue tuning; a
 * bit more vivid on dark as a side effect, same trade the rest-state
 * fix already made and the owner accepted there.
 *
 * Download's hover icon color was the more broken case: a literal
 * `#fff`, not a wash-alpha problem at all. White-on-white has no
 * contrast full stop, regardless of the background wash -- it was
 * only ever legible against a dark card. Swapped to
 * `var(--primary-text-color)`, HA's own strongest text token: near-
 * black on light theme, near-white on dark, computed by HA itself so
 * it never needs to know which theme is active. Keeps the "gray
 * family, no accent hue" rule the download button was built under
 * (owner ruling 2026-08-11) -- this is neutral in both directions,
 * not a new color.

 * shipped with -- owner swap, same reasoning as that drawing's own
 * replacement of the earlier comb-and-scissors concept before it: a
 * glyph that reads clearly at small size against the grey rest state.
 * The "NEVER an MDI gear" ruling that ruled out a plain gear for the
 * wrench drawing does not apply here -- this IS a gear, just not
 * MDI's, and the mustache is what keeps it a HAIR house glyph rather
 * than a generic settings cog.
 *
 * SOURCE: images/mustache-gear.svg carries an in-file comment
 * crediting "SVG Repo, www.svgrepo.com" -- a third-party asset, not an
 * in-house drawing (unlike ICON_TRASH/ICON_COMB), same provenance as
 * the wrench drawing it replaces.
 *
 * viewBox is 382.673x382.673 -- square, unlike the wrench drawing's
 * tall-and-narrow 157x256, so none of that drawing's aspect-ratio
 * distortion workaround applies: no `preserveAspectRatio="none"`, and
 * .settings-icon below sizes it as a plain square. Still rendered as
 * an inline `<svg>` rather than through `ha-svg-icon`, matching the
 * wrench drawing's own choice, so a future non-square swap doesn't
 * have to re-plumb the render site.
 *
 * The source file has five `<path>` elements -- the mustache, two
 * screw-hole rings, the gear body (which already carries its own
 * outer-ring subpath), and the inner ring -- all geometry-bearing,
 * concatenated into this one constant in source order (multiple
 * subpaths in one `d` string is exactly how the source already draws
 * the gear body plus its outer ring).

 * The device-meta-row settings button. Copied verbatim from
 * .trash-btn above (same anatomy: grey at rest, same transitions,
 * same disabled state) with ONE difference, per owner ruling
 * 2026-08-08: hover is house blue instead of ember, since this
 * button opens a dialog rather than deleting anything.
 *
 * Sized as a plain square, fixed at 29px in both rest and hover --
 * the same 29px the earlier size-bump-on-hover affordance grew INTO
 * on hover (RULED 2026-08-09, bench pass): a fixed icon size reads
 * cleaner than a size change, since growing the icon on hover shifts
 * the emitter chips beside it. Hover now only changes background/
 * color/opacity, same as .trash-btn.
 *
 * SIZE BUMP (owner ruling 2026-08-09, bench pass after the mustache
 * gear went live): the original 16px/18px sizing -- inherited as-is
 * from the wrench drawing's own box -- was too small to read the
 * gear teeth or the mustache at a glance. Icon and padding both
 * scaled up ~60% together (16->26, 3->5) so the hit-area keeps the
 * same proportions rather than the icon outgrowing its box. A second
 * bench pass the same day dropped the rest/hover split entirely
 * (26->29 rest, so both states land on the hover size, the one that
 * read best) once the size CHANGE itself -- not just the small
 * resting size -- turned out to be the thing that read as unclean.
 *
 * BOTTOM-ALIGNED (owner ruling 2026-08-15, reverses the 2026-08-09
 * top-alignment ruling above): explicit align-self so this button
 * stays pinned to the BOTTOM of its containing cell instead --
 * .device-meta's grid row on the Device side, .trh-header's flex row
 * on the Remote side -- so it stays low against the commands/triggers
 * list that follows, regardless of how tall the Emitters/Receivers
 * chip group above it grows. One shared style, both call sites, so
 * this single change covers both settings gears per the owner's own
 * framing ("both ... should be justified to the bottom of the cell
 * that they're in").

 * The row-level edit button, shared by every surface that swaps its
 * copy-glyph edit affordance for the real pencil (edit-button-pass.md
 * commit 1). RULED (owner 2026-08-11): the helper -- glyph, markup,
 * tooltip wiring, treatment, and size all live here, so one change
 * updates every installed surface. Only PLACEMENT (the helper call
 * site, immediately left of that row's trash can) stays per-surface;
 * a button cannot position itself in someone else's row.
 *
 * Treatment is .trash-btn's anatomy (grey rest, same radius/
 * transitions/disabled state) with the settings button's blue hover
 * (edit opens an editor, same non-destructive family as settings,
 * not delete) rather than minting a third copy of that hover pair.
 * FOURTH bench ruling (2026-08-11): edit and trash now also sit in
 * their own .edit-trash-group wrapper (ir-command-row.ts) with a
 * zero flex gap, so the two buttons' hover boxes butt directly
 * against each other rather than sitting the row's shared 4px gap
 * apart.
 *
 * FIFTH bench ruling (2026-08-11): box matched to .trash-btn's
 * exactly -- 24x24 hover box, same as the can beside it (was 26x28
 * against trash's 24x24, i.e. 2px wider from the padding asymmetry,
 * 4px taller from the 22px icon that pass dropped back down from).
 * Three earlier bench passes (19->20->22px) chased visual parity
 * with the trash can's weight before landing here; the box-match
 * ruling took priority over that pursuit.
 *
 * SIXTH bench ruling (2026-08-11): box held fixed at 24x24, glyph
 * bumped back up within it -- 18px icon / 3px padding to 20px icon /
 * 2px padding (18+2*3=20+2*2=24, box unchanged). Lets the pencil
 * claw back a little of the visual weight the fifth pass's box-match
 * cost it, without reopening the box-size question. Still a shade
 * lighter than the can at equal box size either way (ink fills
 * ~75% x 67% of its viewBox vs the can's ~72% x 76%, confirmed via
 * getBBox on both paths in the second bench pass -- not a CSS
 * stretch, the rendered icon box remains a verified 1:1 square at
 * every size checked).
 *
 * SEVENTH bench ruling (2026-08-11): vertical padding split
 * asymmetric -- 2px both sides unchanged, but top/bottom goes from
 * an even 2px/2px to 3px/1px (3+20+1=24, box still unchanged). The
 * even split was landing the pencil's bottom edge about a pixel
 * above the trash can's, reading as a hairline misalignment along
 * the row; nudging the icon down within its own box by shaving a
 * pixel off the bottom padding and adding it to the top brings the
 * two glyphs' bottom edges into line without touching the box
 * itself.

 *
 * The source file is ONE path holding two overlapping star shapes in
 * the same rotation, wound in opposite directions: an outer point and
 * a slightly smaller inset one. Rendered together under the default
 * nonzero fill rule they cancel in the middle and draw a hollow
 * outline star; rendered with only the first subpath (everything up
 * to the first `z`) the same asset draws a solid star. One file, two
 * looks -- the same technique ICON_EDIT/ICON_TRASH already rely on
 * here, and the reason there is no second SVG asset for the filled
 * state.
 *
 * Fill-based, so both render through ha-svg-icon like every other
 * glyph in this file, never as inline stroke SVG:
 *
 *   <ha-svg-icon .path=${ICON_STAR} .viewBox=${STAR_VIEWBOX}></ha-svg-icon>

 * surface using this must include BOTH.
 *
 * The starred colour (#4dabf7, the app's focus-ring blue) is
 * deliberately NOT the hover wash's #64b5f6: a starred row has to
 * still read as starred once the mouse has moved off it and nothing
 * is hovered. Specificity keeps them in the right order without
 * !important -- `.edit-btn:hover:not(:disabled)` outranks
 * `.star-btn.on`, so hovering a starred star still washes blue, and
 * `.star-btn.on` outranks `.edit-btn`, so a starred star at rest is
 * never grey.

/**
 * The viewBox ICON_DOWNLOAD is drawn in.
 *
 * NOT the source file's own "0 -6 158 158" -- dl.svg's ink runs
 * almost edge to edge in its native viewBox (under 1% clearance on
 * the left/right, ~4% top/bottom, measured by rendering the path and
 * finding its ink bounding box), unlike ICON_EDIT and ICON_TRASH,
 * whose own source drawings carry ~13-16% breathing room baked in on
 * every side. At matching --mdc-icon-size and identical CSS padding,
 * that difference is exactly why the download glyph read larger and
 * its padding read as "almost zero" next to edit/trash (owner
 * observation, 2026-08-12) -- the CSS padding numbers were never
 * wrong, the source artwork just had nothing built in around it the
 * way the other two do.
 *
 * Fix is here, not in the padding: this viewBox pads the SAME path
 * data out to margins of ~12.5% left/right and ~16.5% top/bottom,
 * matched by rendering both against ICON_EDIT's own measured margins
 * and checking the fractions land within a point of each other. The
 * path string above is untouched -- widening the viewBox around
 * identical coordinates is what makes the ink occupy a smaller,
 * centered fraction of the icon box, the same way edit and trash's
 * source files already draw their glyphs with room to spare.

/**
 * The download button. HAIR Closet only for now, sitting inside the
 * shared edit-trash-group between edit and trash (owner ruling
 * 2026-08-11: "I want to place it between the edit and delete
 * buttons"). Padding is .edit-btn's own 3px/2px/1px, unchanged --
 * owner ruling 2026-08-12 was explicit that the padding should stay
 * "similar to the edit button" rather than grow to force a literal
 * 24x24 box; icon is 19px (20->18->17->18->19: a fourth single-pixel
 * bench nudge), so the button sits at 23x23, a shade under edit/
 * trash's 24x24 the same way it has through every pass.
 *
 * Deliberately its own third hover treatment rather than reusing
 * edit's blue or trash's ember: gray at rest, gray wash on hover, no
 * accent hue at all ("we'll keep it in the gray family," owner ruling
 * 2026-08-11) -- download is neither the destructive act trash is nor
 * the editing act edit is, so it earns neither of those two meanings.
 * Hover icon color started as a literal white (fine against the dark
 * card it was designed against) and was later swapped to
 * `var(--primary-text-color)` once it turned out to be invisible on a
 * light theme -- see the hover-wash doc comment above trashButtonStyles
 * for the full fix (owner bugfix ruling 2026-08-12). Still gray-
 * family: that token is neutral in both directions, not a new hue.
 *
 * Sizing history (owner bench passes, 2026-08-12): first pass dropped
 * --mdc-icon-size from 20px (edit/trash's own size) to 18px, since
 * the glyph read visibly larger even at an identical nominal size --
 * see DOWNLOAD_VIEWBOX's own doc comment for why (near-zero built-in
 * margin in the source artwork). A second pass, after the viewBox fix
 * above gave the glyph real margin, took it down one pixel further to
 * 17px and confirmed the padding numbers should stay exactly what
 * .edit-btn already uses rather than grow to force a matching 24x24
 * box. A third pass judged 17px too small once the margin fix was
 * live -- brought back up to 18px. A fourth pass judged 18px still a
 * shade light next to edit/trash's weight -- 19px, still .edit-btn's
 * padding untouched (owner ruling: "just do the padding 1 on the
 * bottom and 3 on the top like the edit button" -- already exactly
 * what this padding is and has been since the viewBox fix, confirmed
 * rather than changed).
