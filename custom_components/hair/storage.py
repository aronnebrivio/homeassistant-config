        whose S/L fingerprint flipped across the classification boundary

        no decoded identity) keep matching on bare fingerprint, so

        THE LOWEST TIER (2026-08-18). A trigger whose bytes never came
        through a receiver does not match its own capture on any tier
        above: a wig-minted trigger holds the file's byte hash, and a
        real press hashes to something else on every press. Such a
        trigger gets one more chance, on the normalized fingerprint,
        and only when the capture decoded as nothing.

        Ambiguity is refused. If two file-sourced triggers carrying
        DIFFERENT codes both answer to the capture's normalized value,
        neither fires: one physical press must not run two automations
        written for two different buttons. A sub-threshold keypad is
