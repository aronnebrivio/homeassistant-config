"""The wig format: ``hair-wig/1`` parsing, validation, serialization.

A wig is a portable IR code set: one JSON file, one remote, raw Pronto
as the payload. This module is the single authority every entry point
shares (drop zone, folder scan, adapters, export): a file either
validates fully or is rejected with a concrete field-level reason,
never half-imported (plan: wigs.md section 3).

Deliberate format rules, restated from the plan:

- Raw Pronto is the payload; NO decoded fields in the file. Import
  routes every signal through the same ``normalize()`` path paste and
  pluck use, so decode happens fresh on the importing install and a
  wig can never carry a stale identity.
- Unknown keys, top-level and per-signal, are IGNORED on read but
  PRESERVED through parse -> serialize, so a future additive key (the
  v0.7.x ``fittings`` list, say) survives an older install editing the
  wig's name.
- ``format`` gates parsing on its MAJOR version only: ``hair-wig/2``
  refuses politely with an update-HAIR message rather than guessing.
- Canonicalization of the ``signals`` array is part of the v1 contract
  (``canonical_signals_json`` / ``signals_content_hash``). It was
  defined as the target a flat wig's FITTING would bind to; v0.9.5
  moved that job to per-row digests (``row_digest``), because a
  whole-file hash cannot say which rows anybody actually proved. The
  canonical form stayed, and is still the definition of "the same
  codes": the duplicate-drop detector and the identity cache both read
  it. What it no longer does is appear in a file or bind a signature on
  a flat wig, which is hard rule 2.

Blocking I/O lives in wig_store, not here; this module is pure.

# changes cell hashes as well as signal hashes.

# claims does. Storing them would let the file disagree with itself.
