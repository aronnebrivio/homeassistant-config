"""Climate entity platform for HAIR (preset-based and matrix-based).

Two operating modes since Cold Cuts (v0.8.8), selected by
``IRDevice.climate_matrix``:

- PRESET mode (the original): discrete mapped commands (mode_cool,
  fan_low, temp_22...) from ``entity_config``. Untouched by Cold Cuts.
- MATRIX mode: the device carries a full climate state lattice in
  ``hair/matrices/<device_id>.matrix.json``; every user action resolves
  to ONE cell via ``wig_climate.resolve_cell`` and transmits that
  cell's complete-state Pronto. Vocabulary (fan/swing strings) is
  verbatim from the file -- the strings are lookup keys AND entity
  attribute values (addendum section 3).

    Home Assistant's state machine reports a climate entity's
    temperature attributes in the INSTALL's display unit, converting
    from whatever ``temperature_unit`` the entity itself declares --
    and matrix mode declares the FILE's native unit, which can differ
    from the install's display unit (see ``temperature_unit``'s
    docstring below). The old restore path read
    ``last_state.attributes[ATTR_TEMPERATURE]`` back as if it were
    already native, which silently applies one uncompensated
    display-unit conversion every restart: 23C -> 73.4 (as if F) ->
    164 -> 327 -> ... compounding without bound.

    This payload sidesteps the guesswork entirely: written and read
    only by this entity, always in the exact unit ``_target_temperature``
    already holds internally, so restore never has to infer which unit
    a bare number is in. See ``_restore_native_temperature`` for the
    one-time fallback path an entity takes on the first restart after
    this fix ships, before it has ever written this payload.

    # every matrix send is a complete state, so fan/swing/temp always
    # travel together. While OFF, setters store state without sending
    # (no surprise blasts; the stored state rides out on the next
    # mode/on action). A resolve miss logs and sends nothing: matrices
    # are SPARSE (census: 158 explicit nulls) and a missing state is
    # file fact, not an error to throw at the user.
    #
    # Matrix mode NEVER reads entity_config.command_mapping: every
    # send resolves from the matrix file, so the Map action is
    # meaningless on a matrix device and the frontend simply hides it
    # (Cold Cuts second half, 2026-07-29) -- no backend enforcement,
    # because a stale mapping is inert here by construction. The
    # documented door: if preset modes ever revive on matrix devices,
    # the mapping comes back through _send, not through these paths.

        A preset with no coordinates behind it still moves nothing but
        the attribute, which is mode0192's own suggestion for
        special-function presets.

        The state effect goes through the same ``_apply_sent`` the
        dispatcher handler uses, applied directly here because the
