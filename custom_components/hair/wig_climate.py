"""Climate matrix helpers: the dimension checklist and cell resolution.

Cold Cuts (v0.8.8). Two consumers share this module:

- The fitting flow derives the DIMENSION CHECK here: a deterministic
  checklist standing in for the full lattice (owner rulings 2026-07-28,
  mockup CC1). Nobody fits 2,689 cells; everybody can fit every mode,
  every fan speed, every swing position, both ends of the temperature
  range, and off/on -- 12 to 20 sends regardless of matrix size. The
  derivation is a pure function of the climate block (file order plus
  sorted temps, no randomness), so every install of the same file
  produces the identical list and fittings accumulate in one ledger.

- The climate entity resolves target states to cells here: nearest-temp
  snap inside the chosen branch, first-of-branch fallbacks for a fan or
  swing the file does not carry, and honest None when a mode subtree
  simply has no such state (matrices are SPARSE -- census found 158
  explicit nulls; absent combinations never became cells at import).

Vocabulary is verbatim throughout (addendum section 3): mode / fan /
swing strings are lookup keys AND entity attributes, so nothing here
case-normalizes or unifies spellings. The one mapping that exists is
MODE_ALIAS, which translates a file's mode key to the HA HVAC mode
vocabulary without touching the stored cell.
