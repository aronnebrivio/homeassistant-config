/**
 * Add Trigger Remote dialog (add-popups, signpost 2, Track 3; drop
 * mode added signpost 3, Track 1 item 3; per-kind source tabs added
 * signpost 3, Track 1 item 4).
 *
 * GATED on Track 1B's bench gate (create a named remote, see it as a
 * targetable device, add+fire a trigger, rename, delete-takes-its-
 * triggers, drawer untouched) -- confirmed passing before this track
 * started. Every creation path below writes into that model.
 *
 * Six tabs, same create grammar Track 2 established (brief section 3):
 * pick a source or none, see a live preview, confirm a name, Create.
 * The footer -- name field, ir-receiver-picker -- is constant across
 * all six tabs now (signpost 3, Track 4 bench-gate fix, 2026-08-17 --
 * see signpost-3-coding-plan.md section 3a), mirroring
 * ir-add-controlled-device-dialog.ts, except the picker is receivers
 * (this dialog's hardware), not emitters. The three Sniffer/Clipper/
 * Plucker tabs below used to stay inert pending a backend contract
 * Track 2 item 2 had, in fact, already built; they call it directly
 * now.
 *
 *   Manual: a blank named remote. No Device Type analog -- TriggerRemote
 *     has no such field, unlike IRDevice.
 *   Closet: ir-wig-picker.ts (Track 1) supplies the source row, same
 *     component and same matrix-row-disabled behavior Track 2's Closet
 *     tab already has -- a matrix wig can never actually be picked here
 *     either through a manual click (see the drop-mode note below for
 *     the one path that changes that), so there is no separate matrix
 *     case to handle in the seeding loop below.
 *   Device: ir-device-picker.ts (Track 1) supplies the source row.
 *     Known gap carried from Track 1 (see that file's header): the list-
 *     level DeviceSummary has no matrix field, so a matrix-backed device
 *     IS pickable here unlike a matrix wig. No special-casing needed
 *     regardless -- IRDevice.commands is already the discrete-only list
 *     (matrix cells live in their own hair/matrices/ file), so seeding
 *     from it naturally yields "the discrete-press subset only" the
 *     matrix rule calls for. A pure-matrix device legitimately seeds
 *     zero triggers; the preview line says that plainly rather than
 *     implying a bug.
 *   Sniffer / Clipper / Plucker (signpost 3, Track 1 item 4): each its
 *     own kind-colored tab now, REPLACING the single grouped-with-
 *     chips "Remote" tab shell from signpost 2 (ir-remote-picker.ts,
 *     retired outright -- see ir-source-picker.ts's header for why).
 *     Plucker renders only when `.pluckerConfigured` is true. Rows are
 *     REAL, live-fetched via the already-standalone-callable
 *     `api.getUnknownDevices({source})` (one call per kind, lazily on
 *     first tab visit, cached per dialog instance). LIVE (Track 4
 *     bench-gate fix): picking a row calls `api.createTriggerRemote()`
 *     with `promoted_from_unknown_id` set to that row's id --
 *     ws_create_trigger_remote's existing promote branch (Track 2 item
 *     2, "USE-as-Remote creation from every source: Sniffer promote...
 *     Clipper and Plucker remotes the same way") copies every signal
 *     on the source into named triggers itself, the same path Track
 *     3.1 already wired for the four catalog surfaces' USE fork. This
 *     dialog just calls it from a second door -- and, unlike the
 *     Closet/Device tabs below, needs no seed loop of its own: the one
 *     call does the whole job server-side.
 *
 * Seeding design (this round's steer, in place of a bespoke atomic bulk-
 * create endpoint): create the remote first via createTriggerRemote(),
 * then loop the EXISTING hair/trigger/create call once per discrete
 * signal, now carrying two fields it gained for exactly this
 * (trigger_remote_id, origin) -- see websocket_api.py's docstring. A wig
 * source's per-signal identity (fingerprint/byte_hash/decoded_fingerprint)
 * comes from the new read-only hair/wigs/signals call, since there is no
 * Pronto decoder on the frontend to derive it locally; a device source
 * reuses hair/trigger/create's existing source_device_id +
 * source_command_id resolution verbatim -- that path already existed for
 * the drawer's own dialog.
 *
 * This is N+1 websocket round trips, not one backend transaction, so a
 * failure partway through the loop is handled with a best-effort
 * rollback (delete the just-created remote, which takes its already-
 * seeded triggers with it) rather than leaving a half-seeded remote
 * behind -- see _create()'s catch block.
 *
 * Origin lands on every path in this track, per the provenance ruling --
 * it is this dialog's whole reason for existing. Both the remote's own
 * origin and each seeded trigger's origin are set to the tab that
 * created them (drop mode records "closet", matching where the dropped
 * wig actually landed).
 *
 * DROP MODE (signpost 3, Track 1 item 3): set `.dropSource` to a
 * WigPickRow and the dialog renders as s11's "Drop mode" frame -- tab
 * row and source picker both suppressed, a synopsis line in their place
 * (`addtr.preview_creates`, plus a MATRIX tag when the wig is matrix-
 * shaped), name prefilled from the wig's label, and the hardware footer
 * (receiver picker, ALL-OFF by default -- `_receiverIds` already starts
 * empty, so drop mode gets this for free) always expanded, no escape
 * hatch back to a source picker. Seeding rides the same `_seedFromWig()`
 * path the Closet tab uses. As with the Device dialog, this is the one
 * path that can carry a matrix wig at all: ir-wig-picker's own `_pick()`
 * refuses matrix rows, so `dropSource` (assigned programmatically by the
 * caller, not by a picker click) is what makes `_isMatrixSource` a live
 * case here instead of dead defensive code. A matrix wig legitimately
 * seeds zero triggers via `_seedFromWig()` (matrix cells aren't discrete
 * signals) -- the preview line says so plainly, matching the Device
 * dialog's pure-matrix-device case above.
 *
 * Actually catching a file drop, running it through the funnel, and
 * opening this dialog with `.dropSource` set is Track 2 item 3 / Track
 * 3 item 3's job (subject to the Track 0 funnel-callability finding,
 * confirmed callable) -- this component only knows how to render and
 * seed once a source is already in hand.
 *
 * Fires `remote-created` with detail: TriggerRemoteInfo & { trigger_count }
 * on Manual/Closet/Device (client-computed seed count); on Sniffer/
 * Clipper/Plucker the detail is the bare TriggerRemoteInfo the
 * promoted create call returns, whose own `trigger_count` field the
 * backend already filled in (Track 4 bench-gate fix retired the
 * "stay inert" exception for these three).
 *
 * SOURCE / REMOTE / RECEIVERS sections (punch list item 6,
 * owner-approved 2026-08-16): the per-tab source body, the Name field,
 * and the receiver picker each now render inside their own
 * `.dlg-section` with a `.dlg-section-head` label -- REMOTE (the
 * hoisted Name field) and RECEIVERS render identically and
 * unconditionally on every tab; SOURCE is absent on Manual and
 * collapses to a header + synopsis line (no picker) in drop mode.
 * Only the SOURCE header's text picks up the active tab's origin
 * color; the Create button lost its per-tab fill and is static green
 * to match ir-duplicate-device-dialog.ts. See `_renderSourceSection()`
 * / `_renderRemoteSection()` / `_renderReceiversSection()` below.
