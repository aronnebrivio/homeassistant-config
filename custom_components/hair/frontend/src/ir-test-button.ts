/**
 * The self-reporting TEST button.
 *
 * Press it and it says what it did: SENT, or SENT . HEARD when a
 * receiver caught the transmission, held for five seconds so you can
 * look at the device and back, then settled to TEST again. A grey
 * corner dot counts how many times this row has been tried.
 *
 * It exists because the alternative kept failing. The result first
 * lived inline beside the row, where its width changed with what
 * happened and shoved every control after it into a staircase; then
 * on a line below the row, where it read as orphaned from the button
 * that produced it AND was never rendered at all by the matrix row
 * renderer, so TEST looked dead on an entire class of device. Putting
 * the result on the button that caused it fixes both at once (owner
 * design 2026-08-02).
 *
 * THE THREE LABELS ARE STACKED IN ONE GRID CELL with only the active
 * one visible, rather than swapped in and out. The button is therefore
 * always as wide as its widest state in whatever language it is
 * reading, and cannot change width when the label changes -- which
 * would reintroduce exactly the staggering it was built to remove.
 * Measuring would also have worked; this needs no measuring and no
 * maintenance.
 *
 * STATELESS ABOUT PROOF. It reports that a code went over the air. It
 * does not tick a checkbox, mark a verdict, or otherwise claim the
 * device responded -- "heard" means a receiver caught the signal, not
 * that the fan spun. Whoever hosts this button owns the judgement;
 * this button owns only the sending.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   <ir-test-button
 *       .send=${() => this._sendRow(i)}
 *       .disabledReason=${emitter ? null : t("...")}
 *   ></ir-test-button>
 *
 * ``send`` resolves to whether a receiver heard it. Throwing is fine:
 * the button settles and re-enables, and the host surfaces the error.
