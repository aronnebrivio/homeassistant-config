# The downgrade guard (0.10.1 item 2)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# WHAT HAPPENED. Bisecting on the live store, a build from before Track M
# rewrote the trigger-remote store on every trigger fire and dropped
# climate_matrix and last_heard from every remote, because its own
# to_dict did not know them. Three matrix remotes came back as flat
# remotes on the release build and had to be repaired from backup. HACS
# lets a user redownload an older release in two clicks, so this is a
# path real installs take, not a bench artifact.
#
# THE GUARD. Every model keeps the keys its parser did not consume in
# ``_extra`` and writes them back LAST, so a newer field survives an
# older build's save untouched. It cannot repair a store already
# damaged, and it cannot help a field the older build actively rewrites
# -- what it does is stop the older build from being the reason the
# field disappeared.
#
# KNOWN KEYS ARE DECLARED, not derived. A frozenset per model, beside
# the class, listing what the parser consumes. Derivation would have to
# read from_dict at runtime, and the failure it would hide is exactly
# the one that matters: a field added later and forgotten here would
# start round-tripping through _extra as well as through its own
# attribute, and the two copies would drift. A test asserts every key
# to_dict writes is declared, which catches the forgetful case at the
# moment it is introduced.
