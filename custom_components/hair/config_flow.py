"""Config flow for the HAIR integration.

HAIR is a hub integration: a single config entry hosts all IR devices.
The user-facing "add a device" experience lives in the admin panel; the
config flow is just a one-time initial setup that:

1. Detects available IR hardware (emitters via the native infrared
   platform, capture-capable devices via the native receiver API or the
   ESPHome event-bus bridge).
2. Aborts gracefully when nothing is found and points the user at the
   setup guide.
3. Creates the singleton config entry once hardware is present.
