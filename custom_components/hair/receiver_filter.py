"""RF receiver detection for the infrared platform (GH #72).

Combined RF/IR hardware (Athom's RF IR Remote and other ESPHome
``ir_rf_proxy`` builds) can expose its RF receivers as ``infrared``
platform receiver entities. HAIR subscribes to every receiver in the
domain, so an RF receiver feeds ambient radio chatter straight into
the unknown-signal store: the GH #72 install accumulated 104k
undecodable signals and 500 phantom remotes in 33 hours that way.
HAIR captures IR only; RF support is roadmapped as an explicit opt-in.

Discriminator (verified against HA 2026.7.2 core source, 2026-07-29):
there is no honest attribute. Core ``InfraredReceiverEntity`` exposes
only ``device_class: receiver`` and a timestamp state; the ESPHome
integration receives ``InfraredInfo.receiver_frequency`` from the
device but drops it (no state attribute, no registry capability). That
leaves registry naming, per the ir_rf_proxy convention where the
firmware's object ids (``ir_proxy_receiver`` / ``rf_proxy_receiver``)
land verbatim in the ESPHome unique_id (``<mac>-infrared-<object_id>``).

Matching rules, chosen against real false-positive traps:

- Only the registry ``unique_id`` and ``original_name`` are consulted.
  Both are integration-assigned and survive renames. The entity_id and
  friendly name are user-editable AND poisoned by device names: the
  test bench's IR receiver is friendly-named "Athom RF IR Remote 1 IR
  Proxy Receiver", so any name-based match would disable the exact
  hardware this guard protects.
- A field reads as RF when it carries an RF claim WITHOUT an ``ir``
  token. RF claims are the ``rf`` token (``rf_proxy_receiver``), an
  ``rf``-prefixed frequency token (``rf433``), an ISM band number
  (315/433/434/868/915, bare or MHz-suffixed: ``433mhz_receiver``),
  or any three-digit MHz token -- RF bands are MHz where IR carriers
  are kHz, so a MHz-named receiver is not an IR receiver. A field
  claiming both (hypothetical combined ``rf_ir_receiver``) keeps its
  subscription: it claims IR, and a wrongly-dropped IR receiver is a
  silent capture outage while a wrongly-kept RF receiver is now only
  cap-bounded noise.
- The ``infrared`` domain marker present in every ESPHome unique_id is
  NOT an IR claim; only a bare ``ir`` token is, otherwise nothing
  could ever read as RF.
