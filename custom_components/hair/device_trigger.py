"""Device trigger platform for HAIR Triggers and named trigger remotes.

Lets the automation editor offer "Device: <name> -> <button>" instead of
picking an event entity by hand (Trigger Remotes signpost 1; the
device_trigger ruling in
docs/internal/plans/trigger-remotes-release-a.md, "Ruling: device
triggers ship in Release A", 2026-08-10). Originally written against the
single HAIR Triggers device; generalized (Add Popups signpost 2, Track
1B-B5) to recognize any HAIR trigger-bearing device -- the drawer OR a
named TriggerRemote -- and to scope subtype resolution to whichever one
owns the device_id in front of it, so two remotes (or a remote and the
drawer) can carry same-named buttons without colliding.

Rename tolerance is the whole point, not an afterthought. HA's automation
editor stores the picked dropdown entry's ``subtype`` as a raw string --
code-verified against home-assistant/frontend's
``localizeDeviceAutomationTrigger``: the editor renders the subtype raw
whenever no per-subtype translation exists, so what is displayed and what
is stored are the same string, and that string is the trigger's CURRENT
NAME, not a stable id. Renaming a trigger after an automation is built
against it would silently strand the automation without the alias-history
resolution below (see :func:`_resolve_subtype`).

Delegates the actual listening to HA's own event-trigger platform
(``homeassistant.components.homeassistant.triggers.event``), filtered on
HAIR's ``EVENT_TRIGGER_FIRED`` bus event plus the resolved trigger id --
the exact same bus event the trigger's event entity already fires
(``trigger_manager.TriggerManager._fire_trigger``). This is a second,
friendlier door onto identical firing, additive and never a second source
of truth: nothing here changes event-entity behavior, and a signal press
still fires both.
