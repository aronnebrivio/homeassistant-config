/**
 * The ledger: who attested what about a wig, and when.
 *
 * READ ONLY, and structurally so. This used to be a tab inside the
 * fitting dialog, which meant it sat next to controls that could edit
 * the very rows it reported on -- and it grew one of its own (jump to
 * the first failed row) because that was cheap to add from there.
 *
 * v0.9.5 moved attestation onto the device: you prove a wig by adopting
 * it, pressing the buttons, and signing once at SAVE TO CLOSET. So the
 * ledger has no session to drive. What is left is a record, and a
 * record's job is to be legible and hard to argue with.
 *
 * Three things it says that the closet row's check cannot:
 *
 * - WHO. A green check means somebody proved the whole wig; this names
 *   them, with their signature state beside the name.
 * - WHAT EXACTLY. Per-row verdicts, including the rows a fitter
 *   deliberately excluded, which are not failures and are not silence.
 * - WHAT HAS MOVED SINCE. A claim about a row whose bytes were later
 *   edited is shown as orphaned rather than quietly dropped. Somebody
 *   really did prove that recipe; it just is not the recipe on the file
 *   any more, and hiding that would make the ledger read as coverage it
 *   does not have.
