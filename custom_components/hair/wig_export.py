"""Save as wig: serialize a HAIR device's command set into a wig.

Export scope narrowed to DEVICES ONLY (owner ruling 2026-08-03).
Sniffer, Clipper and Plucker remotes no longer export directly; they
go through Make Device first, so a wig is always born from something
somebody could actually press. That is what makes an attestation
possible at birth: a catalog remote has no emitter routing, so nobody
could have tested the codes they were about to vouch for.

The wig keeps its ``origin`` stamp, which now always reads ``device``
for a fresh export. The other three values (``captured``, ``clipped``,
``plucked``) still arrive on wigs written by earlier versions and by
other tools, and the editor popover still explains them.

Raw Pronto is the payload. Signals that carry a Pronto code ship it
verbatim; raw-timing-only signals convert through ``raw_to_pronto``;
a signal with neither is skipped and counted, never guessed.
