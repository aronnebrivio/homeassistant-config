"""SAVE TO CLOSET: the plan the dialog draws, and the save it performs.

THE VERB IS DERIVED (Second Fitting amendment v2, owner-ruled on the
bench 2026-08-04) -- nobody picks it. A device with no source is
**CREATE**. A device whose commands still match its source wig's rows
by digest -- renames and metadata edits do not count as divergence --
is **UPDATE**, exactly as it always was. A device whose commands have
DIVERGED from its source wig (any digest added or removed) is
**SUCCESSION**: the save mints a successor wig carrying the ancestry,
and the attestation binds the successor's own rows rather than a row
set that no longer describes the device. This module is the seam
between the device and the wig: it answers "what am I about to attest,
and against what, and which of the three is this" (``build_save_plan``)
and then does it (``perform_create`` / ``perform_update``).

Nothing here decides anything the person did not. The plan reports what
matched, what did not, and where a name differs; every check, reason and
rename is carried back in as an explicit instruction. That is the whole
reason the old fitting session died: state that accumulated behind the
fitter's back is state nobody signed.

    Walks the arriving wig's ancestry newest-first and stops at the FIRST

    supersedes. Reports the counts, the rows the local copy carries that
    the arrival does not (by digest, so a rename never reads as a loss),
    every device sourced to that ancestor with the ALIASES of the
    arrival's rows it still lacks (amendment v2 section 2: the confirm
    names them, it no longer just counts them), and the ancestor's own
    fitting history (``old_fittings``) so the confirm can grade what
    replacing it retires. Returns None when no ancestor is local: the
    field is inert on installs that never had the old wig.

    Both the drop bar (ws_wigs_upload) and Save as new (_do_create) call
    this on the same shape, so the dialog downstream cannot drift between
